### Hey there! I'm Maaz Khan 👋  
I'm a Software Engineer and fourth-year Computer Science student at Farmingdale State College.

🚀 Currently an SWE Intern at Cowan Consulting LC, where I'm building and refining full-stack features for real-world client applications using React, Firebase, and Stripe.

🛠️ I've developed and deployed multiple projects—from a property management platform to an AI-powered productivity tool—focusing on clean UI, usability, and functional backends.

🧠 I’m actively sharpening my JavaScript fundamentals and diving deeper into Firebase, React, and full-stack development through real-world work and personal projects like **Align AI**, a job search assistant powered by GPT.

📚 My tech stack includes JavaScript, Java, React, Node.js, Firebase, and more. I also enjoy learning new technologies, building polished UIs, and solving user-centric problems.

🔍 I'm passionate about learning by doing—whether it's shipping features, experimenting with AI APIs, or taking on freelance dev work. I care about writing code that’s both functional and thoughtful.
